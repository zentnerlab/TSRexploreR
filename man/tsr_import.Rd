Must have the columns 'sample_name', 'file_1', and 'file_2'.
Additional meta-data columns can be added with sample information such as condition and batch.}

\description{
Function to import TSRs from various sources.
}
\details{
TSRexploreR can import TSRs from various sources. Currently, these are BED files,
delimited tables, and TSRchitect tssObjects.

To import TSRs from files, a sample sheet must first be created. The sample sheet can 
be a data.frame or tabular file. It should have three columns: sample_name, file_1, 
and file_2. sample_name specifies the sample name that will be added for that 
TSR in the TSRexploreR object. file_1 should be the path to the file, and 
file_2 can be left blank or filled with NA values.

To import TSRs directly from a TSRchitect tssObject, the TSRchitect workflow must 
first be run up to the 'determineTSR' step.
